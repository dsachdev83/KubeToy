	<h1>About Kubetoy 1.7.5</h1>
	
	<p>This application is a simple Node.js application that is expected to run in a
	container deployed by kubernetes.  It was created to help explore IBM Cloud Private
	by allowing the user to write messages to the log, crash the application, and even
	create and view files in a shared file system.</p>
	
  <p>This latest version added the Cloud Object Storage page, which allows you to configure and integrate
    with IBM Cloud Object Storage endpoints.  </p>

  <p>The Stress page allows you to issue the Linux 
	<a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~apw/stress/" target="_blank">stress</a>
	command.  This allows you to intentionally create CPU, IO and memory access loads in the
	container running this app.  The mutate button was also added that will trigger a 
	mutation alert (new feature of ICP 3.1.0)</p>
	
	<p>This app uses Bootstrap 4.  All the files have been copied locally to this
	application so Internet connectivity is not required and can work in 
	an air-gapped system.</p>
	
	<p>The app was written by jim conallen (jconallen@us.ibm.com) and is made available under
	the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.</p>
